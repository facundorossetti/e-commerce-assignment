## Assignment specifications

Build an e-commerce website that allows users to browse products and add them to a shopping cart. The website should display a list of products, and users should be able to click on a product to see more details. The user should also be able to add products to a shopping cart, view their cart, and check out.

Mandatory Requirements:
The application should be built using Vue 3, tailwindcss, and Pinia (or VueX if you are more familiar with it).
Unit test at least one component of the application.

Nice to Have:
For the data, you can use the json file provided, or create your own. The user interface should be clean and easy to use, and the application should be responsive. A styling effort will be appreciated.
At the end of the exercise share you source code (ZIP or github repo)
